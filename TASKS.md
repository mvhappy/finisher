# Tasks

Spec: `docs/specs/2026-11-01-finisher-architecture-design.md` (§27 holds the spike conclusions).
Spike code, results and report are local-only in `archive/spike/` (git-ignored).

## Spike round 1 (2026-11-02): done

S1–S11 executed on macOS. Conclusions are in spec §27.

## Spike round 2: macOS follow-ups (done)

- [x] S6b: caption word timing — learned boundary correction; p95 46/49 ms vs MFA (held out)
- [x] S3b: end-to-end A/V latency — audio 37 ms early uncompensated; compensated p95 7.4 ms
- [x] S11b: Lottie text — thorvg text rejected for slots; shared fin-text engine injects image slots
- [x] S5b: SVT-AV1 replaces rav1e (9–22× realtime, +1.2–1.5 dB); VP9 rt as reserve
- [x] Drop Intel Mac support (D31, §23, CI matrix)
- [x] Move spikes and evaluations to git-ignored `archive/`

## Spike round 3: Linux, NAS, caption ground truth

- [x] S6c: no permissive human-labelled corpus; TTS refs rejected; ElevenLabs excluded; review render of a real reel
- [x] Caption labeller tool (`archive/tools/caption-labeler/`) for owner-corrected timings
- [x] Linux VM (no GPU): S8 Landlock 90/90, S1, S5b x86 10×, S11b determinism 20/20, S9 deb/AppImage, S10 ext4
- [x] Linux iGPU (Unraid Docker): S4 WebGPU Vulkan + VA-API WebCodecs, S3 1080p60, S5 VA-API 26.7× proxies
- [x] S10 SMB single client: round-1 lease split-brains (111/200); hardened lease 200/200
- [x] S10 cross-machine race: fenced lease required (0 early takeovers, 0 stale writes); SMB defaults in §27.9
- [x] S9 notarisation — notarised and stapled under Maryna's team 9XN7WN8JN2 (API key)
- [ ] Remove leftover empty dirs `/Volumes/Storage-1/.finisher-spike-tmp/` and `Reels/.finisher-spike-tmp/` after the share is remounted

## Blocked on hardware or accounts

- Windows PC (E4): all Windows rows
- Linux real desktop (vsync, Wayland/X11) and Linux S3b latency
- E2 GitHub repo (CI), E6 sync services, E9 Windows signing cert
- Owner: correct caption timings for posing-mistakes-part-1 in the labeller
- Owner: correct the multilingual caption set (12 clips, en/uk/es/pt-BR/de/fr) in the labeller (set mode)

## Open

- D33 i18n-ready from day one (spec §17.1): catalogue library choice in sub-project 4

- S6: end-boundary accuracy; spell out digit words before CTC
- S3b: 240 fps phone check of panel response; Bluetooth/AirPlay output
- S11b: colour emoji in fin-text (COLRv1)
- Cleanup when done: `~/finisher-spike` on the Linux VM (11 GB) and its `finisher-spike/gfx:1` image
